                    <span>Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way back to 18th century in
                        Naples, Italy. During this time, the poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased
                        food that was cheap and could be eaten quickly. Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was
                        affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors.</span>

                    <span>Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from the city it
                        was invented in. During the early 1900’s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching
                        for something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of imitating the
                        notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind. He created a pizza with a thick
                        crust that had raised edges, similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of
                        mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then topped with a can of crushed
                        tomatoes. This original creation led Sewell to create the now famous chain restaurant, Pizzeria
                        Uno. </span>
